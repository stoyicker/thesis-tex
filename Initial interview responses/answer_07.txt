Really quickly, team todo during this sprint?
	GCH.
How would you improve communication within your team and its closest context (PG, OPO, coach, Scrum Master)?
	They don't know who to go to. Requests are made but not in time. Use much more F2F.
In regards to your role only, when you want to distribute information how do you choose how to do it and how to send it to?
  Lync when possible, fallback e-mail, then fallback to daily meeting where all roles are (this happens commonly).
Between product-related, project-level, line-related (management topics) and other sources of information, which is the one disturbing you the most with information that lacks a practical value for you?
	Doesn't really get annoyed. Understands it is for his best. It's good to know how the team is doing.
List different ways of distributing information within your team and its closest context (PG, OPO, coach, Scrum Master) that you are using now or expect to use in the short future. (e-mail, for example)
	Seldom phone. Lacks graphics presence, so it's not that good.
Anything else you would like to mention?
