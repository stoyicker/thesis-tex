Very briefly, team todo during this sprint?
	she was into something related of a new are closed testing, becase the current Sprint has splitted what they had do. 3 different tasks. Unusual sprint. Transitional stage.
How would you improve communication within your team and its closest context (PG, OPO, coach, Scrum Master)?
	Not finding it a problem so doesnt think it should be improved. They do it face-to-face. She would like others to come to them as much as the other way around. She would remove the walls, more face2face.
In regards to your role only, when you want to distribute information how do you choose how to do it and how to send it to?
	Ask PG , FPM, zor OPO who they should talk to if they don√§t know (usually they do).	
Between product-related, project-level, line-related (management topics) and other sources of information, which is the one disturbing you the most with information that lacks a practical value for you?
	Channel-independent, it causes "automated" delete. There are sources that provide information just to "everybody".
List different ways of distributing information within your team and its closest context (PG, OPO, coach, Scrum Master) that you are using now or expect to use in the short future. (e-mail, for example)
	never phone, lync for ppl not in this floor, e-mail for different timezones depending on where reqeusts come from. Special because they communicate f2f way too more than the regular one. They created themselves a contact person to solve the mailing lists problem.
Anything else you would like to mention?
	Not global e-mails.
