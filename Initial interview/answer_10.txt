Really quickly, todo during this sprint?

How would you improve communication within your team and its closest context (PG, OPO, coach, Scrum Master)?
	He has some "experience" on how this works. When they have changes the need for comm grows, so he is going to work on how to deal with this.
	COMM outside of Scrum meetings. On-demand meeting.
	(out of scope) comm with FPM, same as OPO.
In regards to your role only, when you want to distribute information how do you choose how to do it and how to send it to?
	If urgent, F2F. If a lot of info, e-mail (and meeting follow-up, if possible). But F2F if possible.
Between product-related, project-level, line-related (management topics) and other sources of information, which is the one disturbing you the most with information that lacks a practical value for you?
	He is interested in the tests daily, but the TRs are starting to be too huge. TRs are the most disturbing.
	He wants more filtering on the information that he gets for the meeting (he should act as a filter between the PG and the developers).
List different ways of distributing information within your team and its closest context (PG, OPO, coach, Scrum Master) that you are using now or expect to use in the short future. (e-mail, for example)
 	F2F, e-mail.
Anything else you would like to mention?
	Global demos, he wants to let other teams know what they are doing without putting pressure on their team. COP (meetings) are local.
	Evaluate on pre-planning meetings (with the whole team) during the previous Sprint.
