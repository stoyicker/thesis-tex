Really quickly, team todo during this sprint?
	Polishing GCH for delivery.
How would you improve communication within your team and its closest context (PG, OPO, coach, Scrum Master)?
	PG and OPO are in a lot of outer meetings in their time, so they are hardly available. Very low interactions with the team coach as a role.
In regards to your role only, when you want to distribute information how do you choose how to do it and how to send it to?
	F2F within the team and PGP, OPO and SM. And coach they don't talk.
Between product-related, project-level, line-related (management topics) and other sources of information, which is the one disturbing you the most with information that lacks a practical value for you?
	Product throws a lot of stuff daily (TR, tests) that is not really necessary that often. Better to check it.
List different ways of distributing information within your team and its closest context (PG, OPO, coach, Scrum Master) that you are using now or expect to use in the short future. (e-mail, for example)
	E-mail when outside the team, sometimes lync (same purpose).
Anything else you would like to mention?
	He would like to know more about how the "business" part (less restrictive upper-management filters).
