The report is written as a mind-map rather than in a linear basis. This means that instead of writing things as they happen I try to "predict the future" by writing how they ideally should happen. This helps me by moving work from the latest stages of the project which are usually stressful into the early ones which are more relaxed. In addition, by having the concrete guidelines for how every stage of the study should be conducted concentrated on the report rather than distributed across different publications I can use it to drive my research and it is straightforward to realize if I did something different than I was expected to and why it happened.
Therefore, this form of writing causes some TODO notes to be used as well as past tense for tales that did not yet happen. Obviously, these details will be addressed and ensured to make sense upon final delivery.
