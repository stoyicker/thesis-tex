- Is it a case-study? No, because it also involves performing manipulations and evaluate the changes that these manipulations cause. Therefore, if the study were only about observing the situation and proposing changes, like Averianova2014 was, it would be a case study, like Averianova2014 was.
- Is it design research? No, because the solution to the problem of concern is not technology-based and, although it relies upon the application of rigorous methods in the evaluation of the design artifact, the methods for its construction do not feature the same level of rigorousness (this point comes Design Science in Information Systems Research by Hevner, 2004).
- Is it a experiment? Yes, simply it is not a true experiment. The goal of the study is to apply changes to a certain setup and evaluate their impact on a set of variables, therefore it is a experiment. However, since the setup is not completely controllable, it is not a true one, but rather a quasi-experiment, because trade-offs have to be made between how controlled the setup is and how useful the results of the study are. Concretely, it is a Single-Group Interrupted Time Series quasi-experiment because the subjects are observed before getting the treatment applied, then they get the treatment and are observed again.
